# ChainTech Account Management 

This is a simple **ReactJS** application that allows users to create and manage accounts. The app includes a registration page, login page, and an account management page where users can view and update their account information. This project uses ReactJS and localStorage for data persistence.

## Features

- **User Registration**: 
  - Users can sign up with their username, email, password, age, and address.
  - Email validation is performed to ensure a correct format (minimum 3 characters before `@`, domain with 3 characters before `.` and at least 2 characters after `.` like `.com`).
  
- **User Login**:
  - Users can log in using either their email or username along with their password.
  - Simple authentication flow using localStorage.

- **Account Management**:
  - Users can view and edit their account details (username, password, age, and address) in a user-friendly interface.
  - Fields in the account page are displayed as labels and become editable only on click, providing a clean and minimal design.
  
- **Session Persistence**:
  - User sessions are maintained using localStorage, so users remain logged in until they log out manually.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
